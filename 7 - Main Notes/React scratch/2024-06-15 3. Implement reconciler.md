Before the emergence of front-end frameworks, webpage were usually developed using libraries such as jQuery. jQuery is a process-driven library, and developers need to directly call the browser's host environment API, such as DOM operations. This means that developers need to manually manage page status and interaction, and update the page by performing a series of operations.

However with the emergence of front-end frameworks, the way of working has changed fundamentally, from process-driven to state-driven. In the state-driven mode, developers no longer directly operate the host environment API but manage page states and updates through runtime core modules provided by the frontend framework. These core modules, such as in React `Reconciler` and in Vue `Renderer`, are responsible for translating the code written by developers into corresponding host environment API.

`Reconciler` is coordinator, which is responsible for processing the update of React elements and building a virtual DOM internally. The following are the `Reconciler` main thing that are done:
1. **Receive and parse React elements**: Reconciler receives JSX or React elements returned by the createElement function and parses them into a virtual DOM tree structure.
2. **Coordinate updates**: Compare the difference between the old and new virtual DOM trees. determine which parts need to be updated and generate and update plan.
3. **Build a virtual DOM tree**: When a component is updated, according to the generated update plan, Reconciler updates the structure of the virtual DOM tree to reflect the latest component status.
4. **Generate DOM update instruction**: Convert the updated virtual DOM tree into real DOM update instructions, which describe how to apply the changes to the actual DOM tree 
# FiberNode
`FiberNode` (Fiber node) is `Reconciler`'s one of the core date structure of React, which is used to build coordinate tree. Reconciler use fibernode to represent nodes in the element tree, and by that comparing the difference, find out the parts that need to be updated, generate update instructions, and implement UI rendering and updating.

Each `FiberNode` represents a node in the React element tree, which contains the following important fields:
- **type**: 
- **props**
- **stateNode**
- **child**
- **sibling**
- **return**
- **alternate**
- **effectTag**
- **pendingProps**
# Implementing the Reconciler Workflow
![](https://2xiao.github.io/leetcode-js/assets/react-3-7LStg86R.png)

`Reconciler` work flow is generally to perform a depth-first traversal (DFS) on the Fiber tree, first visit the root node, then visit the left subtree and the right subtree in turn, and generate an update plan by comparing the new node (newly generated `React Element`) and the old node (existing `FiberNode`), and mark them differently.
1. **Traversal the Fiber tree**: React uses the dfs algorithm to traverse the Fiber tree. It starts from the root node of the Fiber tree and traverses the structure of the entire component tree
2. **Compare the new and old nodes**: For each Fiber node, the differences between `Reconciler` the new node and the old node will be compared, including differences in the node type, attributes, child nodes, etc.
3. **Generate an update plan**: Based on the comparison results, an update plan is generate to determine the operations that need to performed. The update plan usually includes information such as which nodes need to be updated, which nodes need to be inserted into the DOM, and which node need to be deleted.
4. **Tagging**: In order to record the operations of different nodes, React will tag each node with different tags. For example, if the node needs to be updated, it may be tagged with an Update Tag, if the node is newly created, it may be tagged with a Placement Tag; if the node is removed, it may be tagged with a Deletion Tag, etc.
5. **Update Fiber nodes**: According to the generated update plan and tags, the corresponding Fiber node are updated to reflect the latest status of the component. The update operation may include updating the node status, updating the node properties, calling lifecycle methods, ... 
6. Recursively process child nodes: For each node's child nodes, React recursively repeats the above comparison and update operation to ensure that entire component tree is processed correctly
When all React Elements are completed, a new Fiber tree will be generated. At this time, there are two Fiber trees in total:
- Current: The Fiber tree corresponding to the real UI in the view. When React starts a new round of rendering, it will use it `current` as a reference to compare the new tree with the old tree and decide how to update the UI 
- workInProgress: After triggering the update, the Fiber tree being calculated in the Reconciler `workInProgress` will be submitted as a new one once the update is completed, `current` becoming the reference tree for the next rendering, and clearing the old `current` tree.
