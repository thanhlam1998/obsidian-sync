# 1. React update process
The update process in React can be roughly divided into the following stages:
1. **Update Trigger**: Updates can be triggered by component state changes, property changes, parent component re-rendering, user events, etc....
2. **Scheduling Phase**: The scheduler adds the update task to the corresponding update queue based on the priority of the update task is executed
3. **Reconciliation Phase**: Also known as the Render Phase, Reconciler is responsible for building the Fiber tree, processing the differences between the new and old virtual DOM tree, generating  an update plan, and determining the operation that need to be performed.
4. **Commit Phase**: In the commit phase, updates are synchronized to the actual DOM. React performs DOM operations, such as creating, updating, or deleting DOM elements, to reflect the latest state of the component tree.
