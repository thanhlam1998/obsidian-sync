# Daily Notes
Understand the Astro by doing some tutorials

> [!Info] Astro
> The web framework for content-driven website

1. In astro we are using the .astro file for html loading instead of JSX like react, the structure look a little bit different.
``` JSX
---
const pageTitle = "About Me";
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>{pageTitle}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/about/">About</a>
    <a href="/blog/">Blog</a>
    <h1>{pageTitle}</h1>
    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

    <p>
      I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one
      I built myself!
    </p>

    <p>
      This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

2. As we see, the JS seperate into the frontmatter. This sound great when you can use only HTML and JS without using all the react element.

Itâ€™s also have condition rendering
``` JSX
---
const arr = [1,2,3,4];
---

...
{
	arr.length && arr.map(item => <li>{item}</li>)
}
```
