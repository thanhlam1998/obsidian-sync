# Daily Notes
Let’s continue the prev notes for astro [[2024-10-08]]

## Props passing:
For the props drilling, we can pass through component same as the react component. Then in the children that get the props, just get the prop from `Astro.props`.

In React component, we use React.children to render the child inside component. In Astro, we can use `<slot />` to render children component

```JSX
<div>
	<slot />
</div>
```

## Markdown frontmatter
In the previous, we have some curious about how to add layout for the dynamic markdown item. We can customize our layout for that using frontmatter.

1. Create MarkdownLayout.astro
```JSX title:MarkdownPostLayout.astro
---
const { frontmatter } = Astro.props;
---

<h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
<p>Writen by {frontmatter.author}</p>
<slot /
```

2. Add layout to frontmatter in markdown
```JSX
---
layout: ../../layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro
...
---
```

## Get existed blog posts
You can add dynamic blog posts by name and frontmatter by
```JSX
---
const allPosts = await Astro.glob("./posts/*.md");
---
```

## Dynamic Routes
Because astro default using static path, when defined dynamic routing it required to have `getStaticPaths()` to define list of paths that will generate in build time. If we want to get dynamic params, we have to change output into `server` or `hybrid` (we will find more about this later)

```JSX title:src/pages/tags/[tag].astro
---
import BaseLayout from '../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return [
    { params: { tag: "astro" } },
    { params: { tag: "successes" } },
    { params: { tag: "community" } },
    { params: { tag: "blogging" } },
    { params: { tag: "setbacks" } },
    { params: { tag: "learning in public" } },
  ];
}

const { tag } = Astro.params;
---
<BaseLayout pageTitle={tag}>
  <p>Posts tagged with {tag}</p>
</BaseLayout>
```
By this way, we can enter the page with defined tags
`http://localhost:4321/tags/astro` 

But if we enter like `http://localhost:4321/tags/abc` we’ll get not found page
