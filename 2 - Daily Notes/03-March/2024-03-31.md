5 Aspect of complexity:
- Shared mutable state
- Side-effects
- Dependencies
- Control flow
- Code size

1st aspect of complexity - mutable state
- Hard to reason about
- Implicit time dependency
- Explosion of state space
- Hard to parallelize
What is mutable state, a state is mutable when it's property not change by another action. It we change one varible value for many function, you will don't know:
- Which step cause the problem
- You can not change the process, the position that you place the variable, you have to keep it sequence to have correct value

2nd aspect of complexity - Side effect
- Async call
- UI render
- Network call

3rd aspect of complexity - Dependencies
- Class dependency: object creation dependency
- Interface dependency: messages dependency
- Temporal dependency: mutable state/side-effect dependency
Golden rule: Things that change more should depend on things that change less often
